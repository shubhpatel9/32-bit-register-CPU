# Computer-Architecture
•	Designed up a 32-bit register CPU which runs MIPS instruction set architecture (Assembly language) using Verilog HDL
•	Implemented 20+ MIPS instructions of I (immediate), J (jump), and R (register) types
•	Sped up the CPU by implementing the pipelining approach and designing the processor as a Mealy state machine so instructions only went to states necessary for execution.
•	Used a testbench in Verilog for exercising and verifying the functional correctness of the CPU logic.
